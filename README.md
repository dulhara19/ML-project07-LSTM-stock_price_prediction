## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Project Overview

This project involves building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict stock prices using historical stock data. The LSTM model is well-suited for this task due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series data, such as stock prices.

The model was trained on historical stock price data and aims to predict the future stock prices over a specific time window. It also involves exploring data preprocessing techniques like First-Order Differencing to make the time series stationary, which helps improve the accuracy of predictions.

The notebook is freely available, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for others interested in time series forecasting using LSTMs.
Features

Time Series Forecasting: Prediction of stock prices using LSTM.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
Visualizations: Plotting actual vs. predicted values, future predictions, and training loss over epochs.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization using MinMaxScaler, and handling outliers.

Key Technologies

Python: Core programming language used.
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used to build and train the LSTM model.
NumPy & Pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
Matplotlib: For visualizations.
Scikit-Learn: For data preprocessing tasks like scaling and train-test splitting.

Dataset

The dataset used for training is historical stock price data. It contains features such as:

Date: The date the stock price data was recorded.
Open, High, Low, Close: The stock prices at different times during the trading day.
Volume: The total number of shares traded on that day.

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to focus primarily on the 'Close' price for prediction.
